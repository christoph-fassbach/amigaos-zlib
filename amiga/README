AmigaOS 68k tested working with latest NDK 3.2.1 with libz v1.2.11.

AmigaOS3 / 68k / SAS/C 6.58
---------------------------
Due to the absence of cmake and autoconf tools, there is only a static configuration script.
From project root, run

  execute amiga/configure68k.sas
  smake clean all test

Note:
Makefile.pup stays largely untested for the time being.
